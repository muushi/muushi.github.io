  <p>
  I'm a 23-year old Computer Science student in Aalto University. My interests range from web and front-end development to UI design and service design and engineering, in which I hope to pursue my Master's degree after finishing my Bachelor's. I speak fluent English, and my mother tongues are Finnish and Swedish. I have a relatively long history in the student life in Otaniemi - I've been a member of the board of the <a href="http://tietokilta.fi"> Computer Science Guild</a> at Aalto University for three years, acting as board chairperson for the year 2017.
  <br><br>
  From the volunteer positions of trust I've held during my study years I've learned a lot about event planning and production, creative problem solving and leadership - especially in terms of motivating and inspiring people in their field of responsibility. I consider myself as a "can-do"-person with a positive attitude, and am capable of adapting to different environments quickly.
  <br><br>
  My current goals are to finish my Bachelor's degree within the next academic year and to work on my professional skillsets via both schoolwork and personal projects.

  <a href="https://github.com/muushi/aa-club">aa-club</a> - another handy tool for Fridays
</h4>
<p><a href="muushi.github.io/aa-club">live demo</a></p>
<p>it all began when I realized that the <a href="https://www.alko.fi/">Alko</a> webpage is a bit.. interesting to navigate? So I decided to do <em>something</em></p>

<h4>
  <a href="https://github.com/muushi/ambitube">AMBITUBE</a> - Ambilight meets YouTube a.k.a. Friday simulator
</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.niksula.hut.fi/~sivaron1/01/ambitube/">live demo</a></p>
<p>simple JavaScript, a HTML5 canvas and a color palette to die for<br>sadly the API to grab YouTube videos was killed, but it still works for mp4 videos</p>

<h4>
  <a href="https://github.com/muushi/poli16/tree/gh-pages">POLIN APPRO</a> - Event website
</h4>
<p><a href="http://muushi.github.io/poli16/">live demo</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.polinappro.fi">Polin Appro</a> is an annually organized bar crawl in central Helsinki, attended by approximately 1200 persons. A simple website matched visually to the event theme (video games) to broadcast information.</p>

<h3>Generic designs/mockups</h3>

<h4>
  <a href="https://www.niksula.hut.fi/~sivaron1/01/design/silencio/">silenc.io - a social media app mockup as coursework</a>
</h4>
<p>A mockup for an application which would hijack notifications and present them to you after a self-decided time period as a way to increase productivity and decrease continuous phone disruptions. Done as coursework for the course Social Media in Aalto University.</p>

<h4>
  <a href="https://www.niksula.hut.fi/~sivaron1/01/design/piikki/">Piikki - a tracking system for usage</a>
</h4>
<p>Did a few UI view mockups for a friend who likes to code, but not to design. The app's idea was to have users who have a certain amount of inventory and can use it to mark up what they have used (e.g. a trust-based candy vending machine which is upheld by the users)</p>
